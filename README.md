**Overview:**

This project implements a simple 2-bit adder using VHDL. The adder takes two 2-bit binary inputs along with a carry-in and produces a 2-bit sum along with a carry-out.

**Features:**

Inputs: Two 2-bit binary numbers (A and B), and a carry-in (Cin).<br/>
Outputs: A 2-bit sum (Sum) and a carry-out (Cout).<br/>
Modular Design: Easily scalable to higher-bit adders.<br/>
Synthesis-Ready: Designed to run on Xilinx-based FPGA platforms.<br/>

**Usage:**

This project is ideal for learning binary arithmetic operations, digital logic design, and working with VHDL syntax. It can be expanded into larger bit-width adders or integrated into ALUs for more complex projects.

Feel free to explore, clone, and experiment with the design!
